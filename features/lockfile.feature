Feature: Creating and reading the Berkshelf lockfile
  As a user
  I want my versions to be locked even when I don't specify versions in my Berksfile
  So when I share my repository, all other developers get the same versions that I did when I installed.

  Scenario: Writing the Berksfile.lock
    Given the cookbook store has the cookbooks:
      | fake | 1.0.0 |
    And I write to "Berksfile" with:
      """
      cookbook 'fake', '1.0.0'
      """
    When I successfully run `berks install`
    Then the file "Berksfile.lock" should contain JSON:
      """
      {
        "sha":"80396ed07db133e0192593adebb360c27eed88c2",

          "fake":{
            "constraint":"= 1.0.0",
